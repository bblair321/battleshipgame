1. Iteration 3 did not provide an interaction pattern. How did you approach designing this iteration? If you did not get to Iteration 3, reflect on how you think you wouldâ€™ve approached the design and problem solving process.
    We thought about a step by step approch. The information we did have in iteration three helped us to form an idea of how we would put all the functionality we built in the Ship, Cell and Board classes. We created a new class called Game and created methods in order to run the game. We had to display the main menu, start the game, allow the computer to place the ships by building two helper methods, allow the player to place its ships, create a loop for both the computer turn and the player turn and a final method for when the game is over.

2. If you had one more day to work on this project, what would you work on?
    Create more functionality. Spend more time the methods we used. Try creating those method a different way and understanding its different uses.

3. Describe the pairing techniques you used while working on this project.
    We were both live everytime we had a working session. We took turns switching from partner A to partner B.

4. Describe how feedback was shared over the course of this project.
    Since we only worked during live sessions we offered echother feedback as we were going through the tasks. Whomever was in the the navigater possition was giving the driver feeback as the driver was working the code.# battleshipgameruby
